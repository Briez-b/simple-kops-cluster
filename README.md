## Repository with simple cluster deployment.

**Here you can find:**
1) Deployment, service, ingress and configMap manifests
2) ./deploy.sh - script to create cluster with Kops and deploy everything:
3) /practice-docs - folder with my kubernetes practice notes(documented everything what I did with this cluster)
